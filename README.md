Real Estate Investment Contract

The Real Estate Investment Contract is a smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain using the Solidity programming language. The contract uses Chainlink's real-time data feeds to automatically invest in real estate assets based on market trends and other variables.

<h1>Overview</h1>

The Real Estate Investment Contract allows investors to capitalize on real estate opportunities without having to monitor the market themselves. The contract uses Chainlink's price feeds for real-time market data on the property's price, rental income, and vacancy rate. Investors can invest in properties by specifying the property type, location, and maximum investment amount. The contract checks if the property meets the investment criteria based on the current market data and transfers funds to the seller if the property is a good investment.
